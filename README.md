Hello, I am john gilliland. A software developer [[resume](https://johng.info/resume)]
from Kentucky now residing in beautiful Colorado.

I work mostly in the Microsoft stack but I enjoy infosec and learning linux as well. I have a variety of code projects here, though most are only partially complete due to the demands of being a full time engineer.
